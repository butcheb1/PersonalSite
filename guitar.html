<p>I began playing guitar when I was in eighth grade.  This hobby of mine has not been as long as my <a href="http://www.tcnj.edu/~butcheb1/personalsite/hiking.html">hiking</a> hobby.  I started playing rock standards like "Voodoo Chile" and "Hey Joe" but soon became interested in jazz music.  As a sophomore, I played a solo in my school secondary jazz band and junior and senior year was the main guitar player for the primary jazz ensemble.  It was a lot of fun driving across the country to perform at jazz competitions and concerts in places like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boston</li>
<li>West Orange</li>
<li>Disney World</li>
</ul>

<p>The model of guitars that I've owned include:</p>
<table>

<th scope="col">Stagg</th>
<th scope="col">Ibanez</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">Model</th>
<td>Epiphone</td>
<td>BLK</td>
<td>Artcore</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The best moment of my time playing guitar is when our jazz band got first place at the prestigious <a href="http://festival.berkleejazz.org">Berklee High School Jazz Festival.</a>  I feel like playing guitar has made me have a better work ethic due to all of the practicing and hard work I had to put into it in order to obtain a position I aquired.</p>
