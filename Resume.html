  <p>I have been playing guitar since I was in eighth grade about six years ago and have been performing in jazz bands since my sophomore year of high school about three years ago.  Within this time, I have been able to improve my ability to conduct improvisation and sight reading exponentially as well as learn about many new musical aspects essential to jazz.  Given my years of experience, I feel as if I am qualified to be part of such a group of performers representing TCNJ. </p>

    <h2>Strenths</h2>
    <p>I have a very good sense in playing chords of all kinds and how to comp during necessary conditions.  Also I feel as if I can give myself enough room for error in case I have to sight read.</p>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:#bbb;">
    <h2>Improvement</h2>
    <p>I need to work on my ability to improvise over certain chord progressions that steer out of key and in general work on my sight reading when it comes to playing melodies with the rest of the band.</p>
