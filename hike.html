<p>I began hiking when I joined Boy Scout over ten years ago.  My troop started small hikes through out the Appalachian Trail where we built up our navigation skills and our stamina in our young yet energetic bodies.  This is before I started playing <a href="http://www.tcnj.edu/~butcheb1/personalsite/guitar.html">guitar,</a> so I had more time to dedicate to hiking.  After a while it became apparent we could handle more extreme hiking trails and traveled to places like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jokey Hollow</li>
<li>Apshawa Preserve</li>
<li>Norvin Green</li>
</ul>

<p>We also hiked in more unconventional places like New York City and saw landmarks such as:</p>

<th scope="col">Times Square</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">Time Spent There</th>
<td>1 Hour</td>
<td>1/2 Hour</td>
<td>3 Hours</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>My favorite moment in my hiking career was going to <a href="https://www.summitpost.org/high-point-new-jersey/152438">High Point.</a> I got to see the highest point in New Jersey and see for miles and into neighboring states as well as climb on the ancient tower that stands on top of it.</p>
